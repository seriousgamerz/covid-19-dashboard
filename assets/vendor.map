When a component has a class, its template's `this` value\n    is an instance of the component class.\n  \n    ## Template-only Components\n  \n    The simplest way to create a component is to create a template file in\n    `app/templates/components`. For example, if you name a template\n    `app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs`:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>\n    <img src={{@person.avatar}}>\n    <p class='signature'>{{@person.signature}}</p>\n    ```\n  \n    You will be able to use `<PersonProfile />` to invoke this component elsewhere\n    in your application:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />\n    ```\n  \n    Note that component names are capitalized here in order to distinguish them\n    from regular HTML elements, but they are dasherized in the file system.\n  \n    While the angle bracket invocation form is generally preferred, it is also\n    possible to invoke the same component with the `{{person-profile}}` syntax:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    {{person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n    ```\n  \n    Note that with this syntax, you use dashes in the component name and\n    arguments are passed without the `@` sign.\n  \n    In both cases, Ember will render the content of the component template we\n    created above. The end result will be something like this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <h1>Tomster</h1>\n    <img src=\"https://emberjs.com/tomster.jpg\">\n    <p class='signature'>Out of office this week</p>\n    ```\n  \n    ## File System Nesting\n  \n    Components can be nested inside sub-folders for logical groupping. For\n    example, if we placed our template in\n    `app/templates/components/person/short-profile.hbs`, we can invoke it as\n    `<Person::ShortProfile />`:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <Person::ShortProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />\n    ```\n  \n    Or equivalently, `{{person/short-profile}}`:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    {{person/short-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n    ```\n  \n    ## Yielding Contents\n  \n    You can use `yield` inside a template to include the **contents** of any block\n    attached to the component. The block will be executed in its original context:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the current context. }}\n    </PersonProfile>\n    ```\n  \n    or\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n      <p>Admin mode</p>\n      {{! Executed in the current context. }}\n    {{/person-profile}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>\n    {{yield}}\n    ```\n  \n    ## Customizing Components With JavaScript\n  \n    If you want to customize the component in order to handle events, transform\n    arguments or maintain internal state, you implement a subclass of `Component`.\n  \n    One example is to add computed properties to your component:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      displayName: computed('person.title', 'person.firstName', 'person.lastName', function() {\n        let { title, firstName, lastName } = this;\n  \n        if (title) {\n          return `${title} ${lastName}`;\n        } else {\n          return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    And then use it in the component's template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>\n    {{yield}}\n    ```\n  \n    ## Customizing a Component's HTML Element in JavaScript\n  \n    ### HTML Tag\n  \n    The default HTML tag name used for a component's HTML representation is `div`.\n    This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.\n  \n    Consider the following component class:\n  \n    ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'em'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    When invoked, this component would produce output that looks something like\n    this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n    ```\n  \n    ### HTML `class` Attribute\n  \n    The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a\n    `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce output that looks like this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n    property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return\n    value of these properties will be added as part of the value for the\n    components's `class` attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class'],\n      classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n  \n      propertyA: 'from-a',\n      propertyB: computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Note that `classNames` and `classNameBindings` is in addition to the `class`\n    attribute passed with the angle bracket invocation syntax. Therefore, if this\n    component was invoked like so:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <MyWidget class=\"from-invocation\" />\n    ```\n  \n    The resulting HTML will look similar to this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"from-invocation ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n    itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name\n    will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n  \n      hovered: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Custom Class Names for Boolean Values\n  \n    When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n    than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n    preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n  \n      awesome: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n    camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n  \n      isUrgent: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n    traversing a path relative to the component itself:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['messages.empty'],\n  \n      messages: EmberObject.create({\n        empty: true\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and\n    and a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding\n    like this:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n    export default Component.extend({\n      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],\n      isEnabled: true\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component when the `isEnabled` property is true will produce\n    HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking it when the `isEnabled` property on the component is `false` will\n    produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic update\n    of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML\n    representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n    will be removed.\n  \n    Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n    [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n    information about concatenated properties.\n  \n    ### Other HTML Attributes\n  \n    The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an\n    `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the component.\n    The return value of these properties will be used as the value of the component's\n    HTML associated attribute:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['href'],\n  \n      href: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between\n    the source property and the destination property:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'a',\n      attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n  \n      url: 'http://google.com'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    HTML attributes passed with angle bracket invocations will take precedence\n    over those specified in `attributeBindings`. Therefore, if this component was\n    invoked like so:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <MyAnchor href=\"http://bing.com\" @url=\"http://google.com\" />\n    ```\n  \n    The resulting HTML will looks like this:\n  \n    ```html\n    <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://bing.com\"></a>\n    ```\n  \n    Note that the `href` attribute is ultimately set to `http://bing.com`,\n    despite it having attribute binidng to the `url` property, which was\n    set to `http://google.com`.\n  \n    Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n    mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-use.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'use',\n      attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n  \n      xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n    ```\n  \n    If the value of a property monitored by `attributeBindings` is a boolean, the\n    attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n  \n      disabled: false\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n  \n    ```html\n    <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" />\n    ```\n  \n    `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'input',\n      attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n  \n      disabled: computed(function() {\n        if (someLogic) {\n          return true;\n        } else {\n          return false;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the\n    value of the property used in `attributeBindings`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      tagName: 'form',\n      attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],\n      novalidate: null\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n    update of the  HTML attribute in the component's HTML output.\n  \n    `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See\n    [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n    information about concatenated properties.\n  \n    ## Layouts\n  \n    The `layout` property can be used to dynamically specify a template associated\n    with a component class, instead of relying on Ember to link together a\n    component class and a template based on file names.\n  \n    In general, applications should not use this feature, but it's commonly used\n    in addons for historical reasons.\n  \n    The `layout` property should be set to the default export of a template\n    module, which is the name of a template file without the `.hbs` extension.\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n    <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n      import Component from '@ember/component';\n      import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';\n  \n      export default Component.extend({\n        layout\n      });\n    ```\n  \n    If you invoke the component:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <PersonProfile>\n      <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n      <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n    </PersonProfile>\n    ```\n  \n    or\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#person-profile}}\n      <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n      <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n    {{/person-profile}}\n    ```\n  \n    It will result in the following HTML output:\n  \n    ```html\n    <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n      <div class=\"details\">\n      <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n      <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ## Handling Browser Events\n  \n    Components can respond to user-initiated events in one of three ways: passing\n    actions with angle bracket invocation, adding event handler methods to the\n    component's class, or adding actions to the component's template.\n  \n    ### Passing Actions With Angle Bracket Invocation\n  \n    For one-off events specific to particular instance of a component, it is possible\n    to pass actions to the component's element using angle bracket invocation syntax.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <MyWidget {{action 'firstWidgetClicked'}} />\n  \n    <MyWidget {{action 'secondWidgetClicked'}} />\n    ```\n  \n    In this case, when the first component is clicked on, Ember will invoke the\n    `firstWidgetClicked` action. When the second component is clicked on, Ember\n    will invoke the `secondWidgetClicked` action instead.\n  \n    Besides `{{action}}`, it is also possible to pass any arbitrary element modifiers\n    using the angle bracket invocation syntax.\n  \n    ### Event Handler Methods\n  \n    Components can also respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method\n    that matches the event name. This approach is appropriate when the same event\n    should be handled by all instances of the same component.\n  \n    An event object will be passed as the argument to the event handler method.\n  \n    ```app/components/my-widget.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      click(event) {\n        // `event.target` is either the component's element or one of its children\n        let tag = event.target.tagName.toLowerCase();\n        console.log('clicked on a `<${tag}>` HTML element!');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    In this example, whenever the user clicked anywhere inside the component, it\n    will log a message to the console.\n  \n    It is possible to handle event types other than `click` by implementing the\n    following event handler methods. In addition, custom events can be registered\n    by using `Application.customEvents`.\n  \n    Touch events:\n  \n    * `touchStart`\n    * `touchMove`\n    * `touchEnd`\n    * `touchCancel`\n  \n    Keyboard events:\n  \n    * `keyDown`\n    * `keyUp`\n    * `keyPress`\n  \n    Mouse events:\n  \n    * `mouseDown`\n    * `mouseUp`\n    * `contextMenu`\n    * `click`\n    * `doubleClick`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n  \n    Form events:\n  \n    * `submit`\n    * `change`\n    * `focusIn`\n    * `focusOut`\n    * `input`\n  \n    Drag and drop events:\n  \n    * `dragStart`\n    * `drag`\n    * `dragEnter`\n    * `dragLeave`\n    * `dragOver`\n    * `dragEnd`\n    * `drop`\n  \n    ### `{{action}}` Helper\n  \n    Instead of handling all events of a particular type anywhere inside the\n    component's element, you may instead want to limit it to a particular\n    element in the component's template. In this case, it would be more\n    convenient to implement an action instead.\n  \n    For example, you could implement the action `hello` for the `person-profile`\n    component:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      actions: {\n        hello(name) {\n          console.log(\"Hello\", name);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    And then use it in the component's template:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n    <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>\n  \n    <button {{action 'hello' @person.name}}>\n      Say Hello to {{@person.name}}\n    </button>\n    ```\n  \n    When the user clicks the button, Ember will invoke the `hello` action,\n    passing in the current value of `@person.name` as an argument.\n  \n    See [Ember.Templates.helpers.action](/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/action?anchor=action).\n  \n    @class Component\n    @extends Ember.CoreView\n    @uses Ember.TargetActionSupport\n    @uses Ember.ClassNamesSupport\n    @uses Ember.ActionSupport\n    @uses Ember.ViewMixin\n    @uses Ember.ViewStateSupport\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Component = _views.CoreView.extend(_views.ChildViewsSupport, _views.ViewStateSupport, _views.ClassNamesSupport, _runtime.TargetActionSupport, _views.ActionSupport, _views.ViewMixin, (_CoreView$extend = {\n    isComponent: true,\n    init: function init() {\n      this._super.apply(this, arguments);\n\n      this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS] = false;\n      this[DIRTY_TAG] = (0, _validator.createTag)();\n      this[BOUNDS] = null;\n\n      if (true\n      /* DEBUG */\n      && this.renderer._destinedForDOM && this.tagName === '') {\n        var eventNames = [];\n        var eventDispatcher = (0, _owner.getOwner)(this).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');\n        var events = eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents || {}; // tslint:disable-next-line:forin\n\n        for (var key in events) {\n          var methodName = events[key];\n\n          if (typeof this[methodName] === 'function') {\n            eventNames.push(methodName);\n          }\n        } // If in a tagless component, assert that no event handlers are defined\n\n\n        (true && !(!eventNames.length) && (0, _debug.assert)( // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n        \"You can not define `\" + eventNames + \"` function(s) to handle DOM event in the `\" + this + \"` tagless component since it doesn't have any DOM element.\", !eventNames.length));\n      }\n\n      (true && !(this.mouseEnter === undefined) && (0, _debug.deprecate)(this + \": Using `mouseEnter` event handler methods in components has been deprecated.\", this.mouseEnter === undefined, {\n        id: 'ember-views.event-dispatcher.mouseenter-leave-move',\n        until: '4.0.0',\n        url: 'https://emberjs.com/deprecations/v3.x#toc_component-mouseenter-leave-move'\n      }));\n      (true && !(this.mouseLeave === undefined) && (0, _debug.deprecate)(this + \": Using `mouseLeave` event handler methods in components has been deprecated.\", this.mouseLeave === undefined, {\n        id: 'ember-views.event-dispatcher.mouseenter-leave-move',\n        until: '4.0.0',\n        url: 'https://emberjs.com/deprecations/v3.x#toc_component-mouseenter-leave-move'\n      }));\n      (true && !(this.mouseMove === undefined) && (0, _debug.deprecate)(this + \": Using `mouseMove` event handler methods in components has been deprecated.\", this.mouseMove === undefined, {\n        id: 'ember-views.event-dispatcher.mouseenter-leave-move',\n        until: '4.0.0',\n        url: 'https://emberjs.com/deprecations/v3.x#toc_component-mouseenter-leave-move'\n      }));\n    },\n    rerender: function rerender() {\n      (0, _validator.dirty)(this[DIRTY_TAG]);\n\n      this._super();\n    }\n  }, _CoreView$extend[_metal.PROPERTY_DID_CHANGE] = function (key) {\n    if (this[IS_DISPATCHING_ATTRS]) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var args = this[ARGS];\n    var reference = args !== undefined ?

If the user types text into the textarea, the `@value`\n    argument is updated. If the `@value` argument is updated, the text in the textarea is updated.\n  \n    In the following example, the `writtenWords` property on the component will be updated as the user\n    types 'Lots of text' into the text area of their browser's window.\n  \n    ```app/components/word-editor.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n    import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n  \n    export default class WordEditorComponent extends Component {\n      @tracked writtenWords = \"Lots of text that IS bound\";\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Textarea @value={{writtenWords}} />\n    ```\n  \n    Would result in the following HTML:\n  \n    ```html\n    <textarea class=\"ember-text-area\">\n      Lots of text that IS bound\n    </textarea>\n    ```\n  \n    If you wanted a one way binding, you could use the `<textarea>` element directly, and use the\n    `value` DOM property and the `input` event.\n  \n    ### Actions\n  \n    The `Textarea` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in\n    response to user events.\n  \n    * `enter`\n    * `insert-newline`\n    * `escape-press`\n    * `focus-in`\n    * `focus-out`\n    * `key-press`\n  \n    These callbacks are passed to `Textarea` like this:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Textarea @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n    ```\n  \n    ## Classic Invocation Syntax\n  \n    The `Textarea` component can also be invoked using curly braces, just like any other Ember\n    component.\n  \n    For example, this is an invocation using angle-bracket notation:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Textarea @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n    ```\n  \n    You could accomplish the same thing using classic invocation:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{textarea value=this.searchWord enter=this.query}}\n    ```\n  \n    The main difference is that angle-bracket invocation supports any HTML attribute using HTML\n    attribute syntax, because attributes and arguments have different syntax when using angle-bracket\n    invocation. Curly brace invocation, on the other hand, only has a single syntax for arguments,\n    and components must manually map attributes onto component arguments.\n  \n    When using classic invocation with `{{textarea}}`, only the following attributes are mapped onto\n    arguments:\n  \n    * rows\n    * cols\n    * name\n    * selectionEnd\n    * selectionStart\n    * autocomplete\n    * wrap\n    * lang\n    * dir\n    * value\n  \n    ## Classic `layout` and `layoutName` properties\n  \n    Because HTML `textarea` elements do not contain inner HTML the `layout` and\n    `layoutName` properties will not be applied.\n  \n    @method Textarea\n    @for Ember.Templates.components\n    @see {TextArea}\n    @public\n  */\n\n  /**\n    See Ember.Templates.components.Textarea.\n  \n    @method textarea\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @see {Ember.Templates.components.textarea}\n    @public\n  */\n\n  /**\n    The internal representation used for `Textarea` invocations.\n  \n    @class TextArea\n    @extends Component\n    @see {Ember.Templates.components.Textarea}\n    @uses Ember.TextSupport\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var TextArea = Component.extend(_views.TextSupport, {\n    classNames: ['ember-text-area'],\n    layout: layout,\n    tagName: 'textarea',\n    attributeBindings: ['rows', 'cols', 'name', 'selectionEnd', 'selectionStart', 'autocomplete', 'wrap', 'lang', 'dir', 'value'],\n    rows: null,\n    cols: null\n  });\n  _exports.TextArea = TextArea;\n\n  TextArea.toString = function () {\n    return '@ember/component/text-area';\n  };\n\n  var layout$1 = template({\n    \"id\": \"oodT3nZ5\",\n    \"block\": \"{\\\"symbols\\\":[\\\"&default\\\"],\\\"statements\\\":[[5,[27,[26,0,\\\"BlockHead\\\"],[]],[[28,[24,1]]],null,[[\\\"default\\\",\\\"else\\\"],[{\\\"statements\\\":[[16,1,null]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]},{\\\"statements\\\":[[1,0,0,0,[27,[24,0],[\\\"linkTitle\\\"]]]],\\\"parameters\\\":[]}]]]],\\\"hasEval\\\":false,\\\"upvars\\\":[\\\"if\\\"]}\",\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"moduleName\": \"packages/@ember/-internals/glimmer/lib/templates/link-to.hbs\"\n    }\n  });\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  */\n\n  /**\n    The `LinkTo` component renders a link to the supplied `routeName` passing an optionally\n    supplied model to the route as its `model` context of the route.

A disabled link\n    doesn't result in a transition when activated, and adds the `disabled` class to the `<a>`\n    element.\n  \n    (The class name to apply to the element can be overridden by using the `disabledClass`\n    argument)\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @disabled={{true}}>\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Handling `href`\n  \n    `<LinkTo>` will use your application's Router to fill the element's `href` property with a URL\n    that matches the path to the supplied `routeName`.\n  \n    ### Handling current route\n  \n    The `LinkTo` component will apply a CSS class name of 'active' when the application's current\n    route matches the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's current route is\n    'photoGallery.recent', then the following invocation of `LinkTo`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent'>\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    will result in\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"active\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    The CSS class used for active classes can be customized by passing an `activeClass` argument:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent' @activeClass=\"current-url\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"current-url\">\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Keeping a link active for other routes\n  \n    If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match the current route, you can use the\n    `current-when` argument.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @current-when='photos'>\n      Photo Gallery\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    This may be helpful for keeping links active for:\n  \n    * non-nested routes that are logically related\n    * some secondary menu approaches\n    * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios\n  \n    A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current\n    route is the route this link would transition to.\n  \n    To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='gallery' @current-when='photos drawings paintings'>\n      Art Gallery\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Supplying a model\n  \n    An optional `model` argument can be used for routes whose\n    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become\n    the model context of the linked route:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Router.map(function() {\n      this.route(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{this.aPhoto}}>\n      {{aPhoto.title}}\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n      Tomster\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Supplying multiple models\n  \n    For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple\n    dynamic segments, the `models` argument can be used.\n  \n    As the router transitions through the route path, each\n    supplied model argument will become the context for the\n    route with the dynamic segments:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Router.map(function() {\n      this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" }, function() {\n        this.route(\"comment\", {path: \"comments/:comment_id\"});\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    This argument will become the model context of the linked route:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.comment' @models={{array this.aPhoto this.comment}}>\n      {{comment.body}}\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42/comments/718\">\n      A+++ would snuggle again.\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value\n  \n    If you don't have a model object available to pass to `LinkTo`,\n    an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose\n    paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value\n    of the dynamic segment:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    Router.map(function() {\n      this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{aPhotoId}}>\n      {{this.aPhoto.title}}\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    ```html\n    <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n      Tomster\n    </a>\n    ```\n  \n    When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will\n    be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.\n  \n    ### Allowing Default Action\n  \n    By default the `<LinkTo>` component prevents the default browser action by calling\n    `preventDefault()` to avoid reloading the browser page.\n  \n    If you need to trigger a full browser reload pass `@preventDefault={{false}}`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{this.aPhotoId}} @preventDefault={{false}}>\n      {{this.aPhotoId.title}}\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Supplying a `tagName`\n  \n    By default `<LinkTo>` renders an `<a>` element. This can be overridden for a single use of\n    `<LinkTo>` by supplying a `tagName` argument:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @tagName='li'>\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </LinkTo>\n    ```\n  \n    This produces:\n  \n    ```html\n    <li>\n      Great Hamster Photos\n    </li>\n    ```\n  \n    In general, this is not recommended. Instead, you can use the `transition-to` helper together\n    with a click event handler on the HTML tag of your choosing.\n  \n    @for Ember.Templates.components\n    @method LinkTo\n    @see {LinkComponent}\n    @public\n  */\n\n  /**\n    @module @ember/routing\n  */\n\n  /**\n    See [Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo](/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.components/methods/input?anchor=LinkTo).\n  \n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @method link-to\n    @see {Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo}\n    @public\n  **/\n\n  /**\n    `LinkComponent` is the internal component invoked with `<LinkTo>` or `{{link-to}}`.\n  \n    @class LinkComponent\n    @extends Component\n    @see {Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo}\n    @public\n  **/\n\n  var UNDEFINED = Object.freeze({\n    toString: function toString() {\n      return 'UNDEFINED';\n    }\n  });\n  var EMPTY_QUERY_PARAMS = Object.freeze({});\n  var LinkComponent = Component.extend({\n    layout: layout$1,\n    tagName: 'a',\n\n    /**\n      @property route\n      @public\n    */\n    route: UNDEFINED,\n\n    /**\n      @property model\n      @public\n    */\n    model: UNDEFINED,\n\n    /**\n      @property models\n      @public\n    */\n    models: UNDEFINED,\n\n    /**\n      @property query\n      @public\n    */\n    query: UNDEFINED,\n\n    /**\n      Used to determine when this `LinkComponent` is active.\n         @property current-when\n      @public\n    */\n    'current-when': null,\n\n    /**\n      Sets the `title` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n         @property title\n      @default null\n      @public\n    **/\n    title: null,\n\n    /**\n      Sets the `rel` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n         @property rel\n      @default null\n      @public\n    **/\n    rel: null,\n\n    /**\n      Sets the `tabindex` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n         @property tabindex\n      @default null\n      @public\n    **/\n    tabindex: null,\n\n    /**\n      Sets the `target` attribute of the `LinkComponent`'s HTML element.\n         @since 1.8.0\n      @property target\n      @default null\n      @public\n    **/\n    target: null,\n\n    /**\n      The CSS class to apply to `LinkComponent`'s element when its `active`\n      property is `true`.\n         @property activeClass\n      @type String\n      @default active\n      @public\n    **/\n    activeClass: 'active',\n\n    /**\n      The CSS class to apply to `LinkComponent`'s element when its `loading`\n      property is `true`.\n         @property loadingClass\n      @type String\n      @default loading\n      @private\n    **/\n    loadingClass: 'loading',\n\n    /**\n      The CSS class to apply to a `LinkComponent`'s element when its `disabled`\n      property is `true`.\n         @property disabledClass\n      @type String\n      @default disabled\n      @private\n    **/\n    disabledClass: 'disabled',\n\n    /**\n      Determines whether the `LinkComponent` will trigger routing via\n      the `replaceWith` routing strategy.\n         @property replace\n      @type Boolean\n      @default false\n      @public\n    **/\n    replace: false,\n\n    /**\n      By default this component will forward `href`, `title`, `rel`, `tabindex`, and `target`\n      arguments to attributes on the component's element.

The first two\n    contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}\n    {{input on-input=(action \"save\")}}\n    {{yield (action \"refreshData\") andAnotherParam}}\n    ```\n  \n    In these contexts,\n    the helper is called a \"closure action\" helper. Its behavior is simple:\n    If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property\n    of the current context. Once that function is read, or immediately if a function was\n    passed, create a closure over that function and any arguments.\n    The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.\n  \n    For example, in the attribute context:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of attribute context }}\n    <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    The resulting template render logic would be:\n  \n    ```js\n    var div = document.createElement('div');\n    var actionFunction = (function(context){\n      return function() {\n        return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);\n      };\n    })(context);\n    div.onclick = actionFunction;\n    ```\n  \n    Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.\n    Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be\n    passed between components and still execute in the correct context.\n  \n    Here is an example action handler on a component:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n    import { action } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default class extends Component {\n      @action\n      save() {\n        this.model.save();\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.\n    This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.\n    Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.\n  \n    * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current\n      context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targeting a\n      service for actions.\n    * `value=\"target.value\"` will read the path `target.value` off the first\n      argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument\n      to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.\n  \n    ### Invoking an action\n  \n    Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any\n    additional arguments are added to the already curried list.\n    Actions should be invoked using the [sendAction](/ember/release/classes/Component/methods/sendAction?anchor=sendAction)\n    method. The first argument to `sendAction` is the action to be called, and\n    additional arguments are passed to the action function. This has interesting\n    properties combined with currying of arguments. For example:\n  \n    ```app/components/update-name.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n    import { action } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default class extends Component {\n      @action\n      setName(model, name) {\n        model.set('name', name);\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/update-name.hbs\n    {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' @model) value=\"target.value\")}}\n    ```\n  \n    The first argument (`@model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)\n    becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply\n    returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including\n    other actions.\n  \n    Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated\n    with `on-input` above. For example:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-input.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n    import { action } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default class extends Component {\n      @action\n      setName(model, name) {\n        model.set('name', name);\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <MyInput @submit={{action 'setName' @model}} />\n    ```\n  \n    or\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' @model)}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      click() {\n        // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template\n        this.sendAction('submit', 'bob');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ### Attaching actions to DOM elements\n  \n    The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called \"element space\".\n    For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{! An example of element space }}\n    <div {{action \"save\"}}></div>\n    ```\n  \n    Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for\n    registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and\n    forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).\n    If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will\n    bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.\n    Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.\n  \n    ### Event Propagation\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note\n    that the closure style actions cannot.\n  \n    Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n    `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n    handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n    example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n      <input type=\"file\" />\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n    ```\n  \n    To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own\n    wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action \"sayHello\")}}>Hello</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js\n    import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';\n  \n    export function disableBubbling([action]) {\n      return function(event) {\n        event.stopPropagation();\n        return action(event);\n      };\n    }\n    export default helper(disableBubbling);\n    ```\n  \n    If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n    own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See\n    [\"Responding to Browser Events\"](/ember/release/classes/Component)\n    in the documentation for `Component` for more information.\n  \n    ### Specifying DOM event type\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n    supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    See [\"Event Names\"](/ember/release/classes/Component) for a list of\n    acceptable DOM event names.\n  \n    ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n  \n    `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.\n    By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier\n    keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n    Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n      click me with any key pressed\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying a Target\n  \n    A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n    which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n    to an object, accessible in the current context:\n  \n    ```app/templates/application.hbs\n    <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=someService}}>\n      click me\n    </div>\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/controllers/application.js\n    import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n    import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';\n  \n    export default class extends Controller {\n      @service someService;\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    @method action\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n  */\n\n  function action(args, vm) {\n    var named = args.named,\n        positional = args.positional;\n    var capturedArgs = positional.capture(); // The first two argument slots are reserved.\n    // pos[0] is the context (or `this`)\n    // pos[1] is the action name or function\n    // Anything else is an action argument.\n\n    var _capturedArgs$referen = capturedArgs.references,\n        context = _capturedArgs$referen[0],\n        action = _capturedArgs$referen[1],\n        restArgs = _capturedArgs$referen.slice(2); // TODO: Is there a better way of doing this?\n\n\n    var debugKey = action.propertyKey;\n    var target = named.has('target') ? named.get('target') : context;\n    var processArgs = makeArgsProcessor(named.has('value') && named.get('value'), restArgs);\n    var fn;\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(action, action, action[INVOKE], processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else if ((0, _validator.isConst)(target) && (0, _validator.isConst)(action)) {\n      fn = makeClosureAction(context.value(), target.value(), action.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n    } else {\n      fn = makeDynamicClosureAction(context.value(), target, action, processArgs, debugKey);\n    }\n\n    fn[ACTION] = true;\n    return new UnboundRootReference(fn, vm.env);\n  }\n\n  function NOOP$1(args) {\n    return args;\n  }\n\n  function makeArgsProcessor(valuePathRef, actionArgsRef) {\n    var mergeArgs;\n\n    if (actionArgsRef.length > 0) {\n      mergeArgs = function mergeArgs(args) {\n        return actionArgsRef.map(function (ref) {\n          return ref.value();\n        }).concat(args);\n      };\n    }\n\n    var readValue;\n\n    if (valuePathRef) {\n      readValue = function readValue(args) {\n        var valuePath = valuePathRef.value();\n\n        if (valuePath && args.length > 0) {\n          args[0] = (0, _metal.get)(args[0], valuePath);\n        }\n\n        return args;\n      };\n    }\n\n    if (mergeArgs && readValue) {\n      return function (args) {\n        return readValue(mergeArgs(args));\n      };\n    } else {\n      return mergeArgs || readValue || NOOP$1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  function makeDynamicClosureAction(context, targetRef, actionRef, processArgs, debugKey) {\n    // We don't allow undefined/null values, so this creates a throw-away action to trigger the assertions\n    if (true\n    /* DEBUG */\n    ) {\n      makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey);\n    }\n\n    return function () {\n      return makeClosureAction(context, targetRef.value(), actionRef.value(), processArgs, debugKey).apply(void 0, arguments);\n    };\n  }\n\n  function makeClosureAction(context, target, action, processArgs, debugKey) {\n    var self;\n    var fn;\n    (true && !(action !== undefined && action !== null) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"Action passed is null or undefined in (action) from \" + target + \".\", action !== undefined && action !== null));\n\n    if (typeof action[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n      self = action;\n      fn = action[INVOKE];\n    } else {\n      var typeofAction = typeof action;\n\n      if (typeofAction === 'string') {\n        self = target;\n        fn = target.actions && target.actions[action];\n        (true && !(fn) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"An action named '\" + action + \"' was not found in \" + target, fn));\n      } else if (typeofAction === 'function') {\n        self = context;\n        fn = action;\n      } else {\n        // tslint:disable-next-line:max-line-length\n        (true && !(false) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"An action could not be made for `\" + (debugKey || action) + \"` in \" + target + \".

It is an extension\n    of the base Handlebars `{{#each}}` helper.\n  \n    The default behavior of `{{#each}}` is to yield its inner block once for every\n    item in an array passing the item as the first block parameter.\n  \n    Assuming the `@developers` argument contains this array:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    [{ name: 'Yehuda' },{ name: 'Tom' }, { name: 'Paul' }];\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each @developers as |person|}}\n        <li>Hello, {{person.name}}!</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    The same rules apply to arrays of primitives.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    ['Yehuda', 'Tom', 'Paul']\n    ```\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each @developerNames as |name|}}\n        <li>Hello, {{name}}!</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    During iteration, the index of each item in the array is provided as a second block\n    parameter.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each @developers as |person index|}}\n        <li>Hello, {{person.name}}! You're number {{index}} in line</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Specifying Keys\n  \n    In order to improve rendering speed, Ember will try to reuse the DOM elements\n    where possible. Specifically, if the same item is present in the array both\n    before and after the change, its DOM output will be reused.\n  \n    The `key` option is used to tell Ember how to determine if the items in the\n    array being iterated over with `{{#each}}` has changed between renders. By\n    default the item's object identity is used.\n  \n    This is usually sufficient, so in most cases, the `key` option is simply not\n    needed. However, in some rare cases, the objects' identities may change even\n    though they represent the same underlying data.\n  \n    For example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    people.map(person => {\n      return { ...person, type: 'developer' };\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    In this case, each time the `people` array is `map`-ed over, it will produce\n    an new array with completely different objects between renders. In these cases,\n    you can help Ember determine how these objects related to each other with the\n    `key` option:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each @developers key=\"name\" as |person|}}\n        <li>Hello, {{person.name}}!</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    By doing so, Ember will use the value of the property specified (`person.name`\n    in the example) to find a \"match\" from the previous render. That is, if Ember\n    has previously seen an object from the `@developers` array with a matching\n    name, its DOM elements will be re-used.\n  \n    ### {{else}} condition\n  \n    `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render\n    if the collection is empty.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <ul>\n      {{#each @developers as |person|}}\n        <li>{{person.name}} is available!</li>\n      {{else}}\n        <li>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</li>\n      {{/each}}\n    </ul>\n    ```\n  \n    @method each\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n   */\n\n  /**\n    The `{{each-in}}` helper loops over properties on an object.\n  \n    For example, given this component definition:\n  \n    ```app/components/developer-details.js\n    import Component from

Here's how you could use the `fn`\n    helper to pass both the function and its arguments together:\n  \n      ```app/templates/components/items-listing.hbs\n    {{#each @items as |item|}}\n      <DisplayItem @item=item @select={{fn this.handleSelected item}} />\n    {{/each}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/items-list.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n    import { action } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default class ItemsList extends Component {\n      @action\n      handleSelected(item) {\n        // ...snip...\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    In this case the `display-item` component will receive a normal function\n    that it can invoke. When it invokes the function, the `handleSelected`\n    function will receive the `item` and any arguments passed, thanks to the\n    `fn` helper.\n  \n    Let's take look at what that means in a couple circumstances:\n  \n    - When invoked as `this.args.select()` the `handleSelected` function will\n      receive the `item` from the loop as its first and only argument.\n    - When invoked as `this.args.select('foo')` the `handleSelected` function\n      will receive the `item` from the loop as its first argument and the\n      string `'foo'` as its second argument.\n  \n    In the example above, we used `@action` to ensure that `handleSelected` is\n    properly bound to the `items-list`, but let's explore what happens if we\n    left out `@action`:\n  \n    ```app/components/items-list.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  \n    export default class ItemsList extends Component {\n      handleSelected(item) {\n        // ...snip...\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    In this example, when `handleSelected` is invoked inside the `display-item`\n    component, it will **not** have access to the component instance. In other\n    words, it will have no `this` context, so please make sure your functions\n    are bound (via `@action` or other means) before passing into `fn`!\n  \n    See also [partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application).\n  \n    @method fn\n    @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n    @public\n    @since 3.11.0\n  */\n\n  function fn(_ref23) {\n    var positional = _ref23.positional;\n    var callbackRef = positional.at(0);\n\n    if (true\n    /* DEBUG */\n    && typeof callbackRef[INVOKE] !== 'function') {\n      var callback = callbackRef.value();\n      (true && !(typeof callback === 'function') && (0, _debug.assert)(\"You must pass a function as the `fn` helpers first argument, you passed \" + callback, typeof callback === 'function'));\n    }\n\n    return function () {\n      var _positional$value = positional.value(),\n          fn = _positional$value[0],\n          args = _positional$value.slice(1);\n\n      for (var _len2 = arguments.length, invocationArgs = new Array(_len2), _key3 = 0; _key3 < _len2; _key3++) {\n        invocationArgs[_key3] = arguments[_key3];\n      }\n\n      if (typeof callbackRef[INVOKE] === 'function') {\n        // references with the INVOKE symbol expect the function behind\n        // the symbol to be bound to the reference\n        return callbackRef[INVOKE].apply(callbackRef, args.concat(invocationArgs));\n      } else {\n        return fn.call.apply(fn, [context].concat(args, invocationArgs));\n      }\n    };\n  }\n\n  function fn$1(args, vm) {\n    return new _reference.HelperRootReference(fn, args.capture(), vm.env);\n  }\n  /**\n  @module ember\n  */\n\n  /**\n    Dynamically look up a property on an object.

child `Component`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-parent.js\n    export default Component.extend({\n      totalClicks: 3\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log totalClicks}} // -> 3\n    <MyChild @childClickCount={{readonly totalClicks}} />\n    ```\n    ```\n    {{my-child childClickCount=(readonly totalClicks)}}\n    ```\n  \n    Now, when you update `childClickCount`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-child.js\n    export default Component.extend({\n      click() {\n        this.incrementProperty('childClickCount');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The value updates in the child component, but not the parent component:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-child.hbs\n    {{log childClickCount}} //-> 4\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log totalClicks}} //-> 3\n    <MyChild @childClickCount={{readonly totalClicks}} />\n    ```\n    or\n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log totalClicks}} //-> 3\n    {{my-child childClickCount=(readonly totalClicks)}}\n    ```\n  \n    ### Objects and Arrays\n  \n    When passing a property that is a complex object (e.g. object, array) instead of a primitive object (e.g. number, string),\n    only the reference to the object is protected using the readonly helper.\n    This means that you can change properties of the object both on the parent component, as well as the child component.\n    The `readonly` binding behaves similar to the `const` keyword in JavaScript.\n  \n    Let's look at an example:\n  \n    First let's set up the parent component:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-parent.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      clicks: null,\n  \n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n        this.set('clicks', { total: 3 });\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 3\n    <MyChild @childClicks={{readonly clicks}} />\n    ```\n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 3\n    {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n    ```\n  \n    Now, if you update the `total` property of `childClicks`:\n  \n    ```app/components/my-child.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      click() {\n        this.get('clicks').incrementProperty('total');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    You will see the following happen:\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 4\n    <MyChild @childClicks={{readonly clicks}} />\n    ```\n    or\n    ```app/templates/components/my-parent.hbs\n    {{log clicks.total}} //-> 4\n    {{my-child childClicks=(readonly clicks)}}\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/templates/components/my-child.hbs\n    {{log childClicks.total}} //-> 4\n    ```\n  \n    @method readonly\n    @param {Object} [attr] the

If true, the listener would be automatically removed when invoked.\n    - passive -- if `true`, indicates that the function specified by listener will never\n      call preventDefault(). If a passive listener does call preventDefault(), the user\n      agent will do nothing other than generate a console warning. See\n      [Improving scrolling performance with passive listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Improving_scrolling_performance_with_passive_listeners)\n      to learn more.\n  \n    The callback function passed to `{{on}}` will receive any arguments that are passed\n    to the event handler. Most commonly this would be the `event` itself.\n  \n    If you would like to pass additional arguments to the function you should use\n    the `{{fn}}` helper.\n  \n    For example, in our example case above if you'd like to pass in the post that\n    was being liked when the button is clicked you could do something like:\n  \n    ```app/components/like-post.hbs\n    <button {{on 'click' (fn this.saveLike @post)}}>Like this post!</button>\n    ```\n  \n    In this case, the `saveLike` function will receive two arguments: the click event\n    and the value of `@post`.\n  \n    ### Function Context\n  \n    In the example above, we used `@action` to ensure that `likePost` is\n    properly bound to the `items-list`, but let's explore what happens if we\n    left out `@action`:\n  \n    ```app/components/like-post.js\n    import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  \n    export default class LikePostComponent extends Component {\n      saveLike() {\n        // ...snip...\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    In this example, when the button is clicked `saveLike` will be invoked,\n    it will **not** have access to the component instance. In other\n    words, it will have no `this` context, so please make sure your functions\n    are bound (via `@action` or other means) before passing into `on`!\n  \n    @method on\n    @for

/>\n    ```\n  \n    creates an `<input>` element with `type=\"text\"` and value set to 987.\n  \n    ### Text field\n  \n    If no `type` argument is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    Search:\n    <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} />\n    ```\n  \n    In this example, the initial value in the `<input>` will be set to the value of\n    `this.searchWord`. If the user changes the text, the value of `this.searchWord` will also be\n    updated.\n  \n    ### Actions\n  \n    The `Input` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in response to\n    user events.\n  \n    * `enter`\n    * `insert-newline`\n    * `escape-press`\n    * `focus-in`\n    * `focus-out`\n    * `key-down`\n    * `key-press`\n    * `key-up`\n  \n    These callbacks are passed to `Input` like this:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n    ```\n  \n    ### `<input>` HTML Attributes to Avoid\n  \n    In most cases, if you want to pass an attribute to the underlying HTML `<input>` element, you\n    can pass the attribute directly, just like any other Ember component.\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <Input @type=\"text\" size=\"10\" />\n    ```\n  \n    In this example, the `size` attribute will be applied to the underlying `<input>` element in the\n    outputted HTML.\n  \n    However, there are a few attributes where you **must** use the `@` version.\n  \n    * `@type`: This argument is used to control which Ember component is used under the hood\n    * `@value`: The `@value` argument installs a two-way binding onto the element. If you wanted a\n      one-way binding, use `<input>` with the `value` property and the `input` event instead.\n    * `@checked` (for checkboxes): like `@value`, the `@checked` argument installs a two-way binding\n      onto the element. If you wanted a one-way binding, use `<input type=\"checkbox\">` with\n      `checked` and the `input` event instead.\n  \n    ### Extending `TextField`\n  \n    Internally, `<Input @type=\"text\" />` creates an instance of `TextField`, passing arguments from\n    the helper to `TextField`'s `create` method.

For example, given a component with the property \"name\",\n    that component's template can use the name in several ways:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n  \n    export default Component.extend({\n      name: 'Jill'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n    {{this.name}}\n    <div>{{this.name}}</div>\n    <span data-name={{this.name}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    Any time the \"name\" property on the component changes, the DOM will be\n    updated.\n  \n    Properties can be chained as well:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{@aUserModel.name}}\n    <div>{{@listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>\n    ```\n  \n    ### Using Ember helpers\n  \n    When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper\n    or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:\n  \n    ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n    {{if this.name \"I have a name\" \"I have no name\"}}\n    <span data-has-name={{if this.name true}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is\n    called \"inline\". A second style of helper usage is called \"block\". For example:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    {{#if this.name}}\n      I have a name\n    {{else}}\n      I have no name\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based\n    on the values of properties.\n    A third form of helper is called \"nested\". For example here the concat\n    helper will add \" Doe\" to a displayed name if the person has no last name:\n  \n    ```handlebars\n    <span data-name={{concat this.firstName (\n      if this.lastName (concat \" \" this.lastName) \"Doe\"\n    )}}></span>\n    ```\n  \n    Ember's built-in helpers are described under the [Ember.Templates.helpers](/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers)\n    namespace. Documentation on creating custom helpers can be found under\n    [helper](/ember/release/functions/@ember%2Fcomponent%2Fhelper/helper) (or\n    under [Helper](/ember/release/classes/Helper) if a helper requires access to\n    dependency injection).\n  \n    ### Invoking a Component\n  \n    Ember components represent state to the UI of an application.

By default the getter\n    will only be called once and the result will be cached. You can specify\n    various properties that your computed property depends on. This will force the\n    cached result to be cleared if the dependencies are modified, and lazily recomputed the next time something asks for it.\n  \n    In the following example we decorate a getter - `fullName` -  by calling\n    `computed` with the property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as\n    arguments. The `fullName` getter will be called once (regardless of how many\n    times it is accessed) as long as its dependencies do not change. Once\n    `firstName` or `lastName` are updated any future calls to `fullName` will\n    incorporate the new values, and any watchers of the value such as templates\n    will be updated:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @computed('firstName', 'lastName')\n      get fullName() {\n        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n      }\n    });\n  \n    let tom = new Person('Tom', 'Dale');\n  \n    tom.fullName; // 'Tom Dale'\n    ```\n  \n    You can also provide a setter, which will be used when updating the computed\n    property. Ember's `set` function must be used to update the property\n    since it will also notify observers of the property:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @computed('firstName', 'lastName')\n      get fullName() {\n        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n      }\n  \n      set fullName(value) {\n        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n    });\n  \n    let person = new Person();\n  \n    set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n    person.firstName; // 'Peter'\n    person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'\n    ```\n  \n    You can also pass a getter function or object with `get` and `set` functions\n    as the last argument to the computed decorator. This allows you to define\n    computed property _macros_:\n  \n    ```js\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    function join(...keys) {\n      return computed(...keys, function() {\n        return keys.map(key => this[key]).join(' ');\n      });\n    }\n  \n    class Person {\n      @join('firstName', 'lastName')\n      fullName;\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Note that when defined this way, getters and setters receive the _key_ of the\n    property they are decorating as the first argument. Setters receive the value\n    they are setting to as the second argument instead. Additionally, setters must\n    _return_ the value that should be cached:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    function fullNameMacro(firstNameKey, lastNameKey) {\n      return computed(firstNameKey, lastNameKey, {\n        get() {\n          return `${this[firstNameKey]} ${this[lastNameKey]}`;\n        }\n  \n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n          set(this, firstNameKey, firstName);\n          set(this, lastNameKey, lastName);\n  \n          return value;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @fullNameMacro fullName;\n    });\n  \n    let person = new Person();\n  \n    set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n    person.firstName; // 'Peter'\n    person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'\n    ```\n  \n    Computed properties can also be used in classic classes. To do this, we\n    provide the getter and setter as the last argument like we would for a macro,\n    and we assign it to a property on the class definition. This is an _anonymous_\n    computed macro:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import EmberObject, { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n      // these will be supplied by `create`\n      firstName: null,\n      lastName: null,\n  \n      fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n        get() {\n          return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n        }\n  \n        set(key, value) {\n          let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n  \n          set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n          set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n  \n          return value;\n        }\n      })\n    });\n  \n    let tom = Person.create({\n      firstName: 'Tom',\n      lastName: 'Dale'\n    });\n  \n    tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'\n    ```\n  \n    You can overwrite computed property without setters with a normal property (no\n    longer computed) that won't change if dependencies change. You can also mark\n    computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    class Person {\n      constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n      }\n  \n      @computed('firstName', 'lastName').readOnly()\n      get fullName() {\n        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n      }\n    });\n  \n    let person = new Person();\n    person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet'); // Uncaught Error: Cannot set read-only property \"fullName\" on object: <(...):emberXXX>\n    ```\n  \n    Additional resources:\n    - [Decorators RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0408-decorators.md)\n    - [New CP syntax RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-improved-cp-syntax.md)\n    - [New computed syntax explained in \"Ember 1.12 released\" ](https://emberjs.com/blog/2015/05/13/ember-1-12-released.html#toc_new-computed-syntax)\n  \n    @class ComputedProperty\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var ComputedProperty = /*#__PURE__*/function (_ComputedDescriptor) {\n    (0, _emberBabel.inheritsLoose)(ComputedProperty, _ComputedDescriptor);\n\n    var _super = (0, _emberBabel.createSuper)(ComputedProperty);\n\n    function ComputedProperty(args) {\n      var _this;\n\n      _this = _ComputedDescriptor.call(this) || this;\n      _this._volatile = false;\n      _this._readOnly = false;\n      _this._suspended = undefined;\n      _this._hasConfig = false;\n      _this._getter = undefined;\n      _this._setter = undefined;\n      var maybeConfig = args[args.length - 1];\n\n      if (typeof maybeConfig === 'function' || maybeConfig !== null && typeof maybeConfig === 'object') {\n        _this._hasConfig = true;\n        var config = args.pop();\n\n        if (typeof config === 'function') {\n          (true && !(!isClassicDecorator(config)) && (0, _debug.assert)(\"You attempted to pass a computed property instance to computed().

This is handy for preventing extremely long route names.\n          Keep in mind that the actual URL path behavior is still retained.\n         The third parameter is a function, which can be used to nest routes.\n      Nested routes, by default, will have the parent route tree's route name and\n      path prepended to it's own.\n         ```app/router.js\n      Router.map(function(){\n        this.route('post', { path: '/post/:post_id' }, function() {\n          this.route('edit');\n          this.route('comments', { resetNamespace: true }, function() {\n            this.route('new');\n          });\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n         @method map\n      @param callback\n      @public\n    */\n    map: function map(callback) {\n      if (!this.dslCallbacks) {\n        this.dslCallbacks = [];\n        this.reopenClass({\n          dslCallbacks: this.dslCallbacks\n        });\n      }\n\n      this.dslCallbacks.push(callback);\n      return this;\n    },\n    _routePath: function _routePath(routeInfos) {\n      var path = []; // We have to handle coalescing resource names that\n      // are prefixed with their parent's names, e.g.\n      // ['foo', 'foo.bar.baz'] => 'foo.bar.baz', not 'foo.foo.bar.baz'\n\n      function intersectionMatches(a1, a2) {\n        for (var i = 0; i < a1.length; ++i) {\n          if (a1[i] !== a2[i]) {\n            return false;\n          }\n        }\n\n        return true;\n      }\n\n      var name, nameParts, oldNameParts;\n\n      for (var i = 1; i < routeInfos.length; i++) {\n        name = routeInfos[i].name;\n        nameParts = name.split('.');\n        oldNameParts = slice.call(path);\n\n        while (oldNameParts.length) {\n          if (intersectionMatches(oldNameParts, nameParts)) {\n            break;\n          }\n\n          oldNameParts.shift();\n        }\n\n        path.push.apply(path, nameParts.slice(oldNameParts.length));\n      }\n\n      return path.join('.');\n    }\n  });\n\n  function didBeginTransition(transition, router) {\n    var routerState = new _router_state.default(router, router._routerMicrolib, transition[_router_js.STATE_SYMBOL]);\n\n    if (!router.currentState) {\n      router.set('currentState', routerState);\n    }\n\n    router.set('targetState', routerState);\n    transition.promise = transition.catch(function (error) {\n      if (router._isErrorHandled(error)) {\n        router._clearHandledError(error);\n      } else {\n        throw error;\n      }\n    }, 'Transition Error');\n  }\n\n  function forEachQueryParam(router, routeInfos, queryParams, callback) {\n    var qpCache = router._queryParamsFor(routeInfos);\n\n    for (var key in queryParams) {\n      if (!queryParams.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n        continue;\n      }\n\n      var value = queryParams[key];\n      var qp = qpCache.map[key];\n      callback(key, value, qp);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, name) {\n    if (!liveRoutes) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var stack = [liveRoutes];\n\n    while (stack.length > 0) {\n      var test = stack.shift();\n\n      if (test.render.name === name) {\n        return test;\n      }\n\n      var outlets = test.outlets;\n\n      for (var outletName in outlets) {\n        stack.push(outlets[outletName]);\n      }\n    }\n\n    return;\n  }\n\n  function appendLiveRoute(liveRoutes, defaultParentState, renderOptions) {\n    var target;\n    var myState = {\n      render: renderOptions,\n      outlets: Object.create(null),\n      wasUsed: false\n    };\n\n    if (renderOptions.into) {\n      target = findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, renderOptions.into);\n    } else {\n      target = defaultParentState;\n    }\n\n    if (target) {\n      (0, _metal.set)(target.outlets, renderOptions.outlet, myState);\n    } else {\n      liveRoutes = myState;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      liveRoutes: liveRoutes,\n      ownState: myState\n    };\n  }\n\n  function representEmptyRoute(liveRoutes, defaultParentState, route) {\n    // the route didn't render anything\n    var alreadyAppended = findLiveRoute(liveRoutes, route.routeName);\n\n    if (alreadyAppended) {\n      // But some other route has already rendered our default\n      // template, so that becomes the default target for any\n      // children we may have.\n      return alreadyAppended;\n    } else {\n      // Create an entry to represent our default template name,\n      // just so other routes can target it and inherit its place\n      // in the outlet hierarchy.\n      defaultParentState.outlets.main = {\n        render: {\n          name: route.routeName,\n          outlet: 'main'\n        },\n        outlets: {}\n      };\n      return defaultParentState;\n    }\n  }\n\n  EmberRouter.reopen(_runtime.Evented, {\n    /**\n      Handles updating the paths and notifying any listeners of the URL\n      change.\n         Triggers the router level `didTransition` hook.\n         For example, to notify google analytics when the route changes,\n      you could use this hook.

For\n        example, in the above example, the `fullName` property depends on\n        `firstName` and `lastName` to determine its value. You can tell Ember\n        about these dependencies like this:\n         ```app/utils/president.js\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         export default EmberObject.extend({\n          firstName: '',\n          lastName:  '',\n           fullName: function() {\n            return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n             // Tell Ember.js that this computed property depends on firstName\n            // and lastName\n          }.property('firstName', 'lastName')\n        });\n        ```\n         Make sure you list these dependencies so Ember knows when to update\n        bindings that connect to a computed property. Changing a dependency\n        will not immediately trigger an update of the computed property, but\n        will instead clear the cache so that it is updated when the next `get`\n        is called on the property.\n         See [ComputedProperty](/ember/release/classes/ComputedProperty), [@ember/object/computed](/ember/release/classes/@ember%2Fobject%2Fcomputed).\n         @method property\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      property: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function value() {\n          (true && !(false) && (0, _debug.deprecate)(\"Function prototype extensions have been deprecated, please migrate from function(){}.property('bar') to computed('bar', function() {}).\", false, {\n            id: 'function-prototype-extensions.property',\n            until: '4.0.0',\n            url: 'https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v3.x#toc_function-prototype-extensions-property'\n          }));\n          return _metal.computed.apply(void 0, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `observes` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can observe property changes simply by adding the `observes`\n        call to the end of your method declarations in classes that you write.\n        For example:\n         ```javascript\n        import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n         EmberObject.extend({\n          valueObserver: function() {\n            // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n          }.observes('value')\n        });\n        ```\n         In the future this method may become asynchronous.\n         See `observer`.\n         @method observes\n        @for Function\n        @public\n      */\n      observes: {\n        configurable: true,\n        enumerable: false,\n        writable: true,\n        value: function value() {\n          (true && !(false) && (0, _debug.deprecate)(\"Function prototype extensions have been deprecated, please migrate from function(){}.observes('foo') to observer('foo', function() {}).\", false, {\n            id: 'function-prototype-extensions.observes',\n            until: '4.0.0',\n            url: 'https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v3.x#toc_function-prototype-extensions-observes'\n          }));\n          return _metal.observer.apply(void 0, Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).concat([this]));\n        }\n      },\n\n      /**\n        The `on` extension of Javascript's Function prototype is available\n        when `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES` or `EmberENV.EXTEND_PROTOTYPES.Function` is\n        true, which is the default.\n         You can listen for events simply by adding the `on` call to the end of\n        your method declarations in classes or mixins that you write.

handler defined\n      on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,\n      you must return `true` from the handler:\n       ```app/router.js\n      Router.map(function() {\n        this.route(\"album\", function() {\n          this.route(\"song\");\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying: function() {\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/album-song.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       export default Route.extend({\n        actions: {\n          startPlaying() {\n            // ...\n             if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {\n              return true;\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       @property actions\n      @type Object\n      @default null\n      @public\n    */\n\n    /**\n      Triggers a named action on the `ActionHandler`.

It is not a\n    concrete implementation, but it can be used up by other classes that want\n    to appear like arrays.\n  \n    For example, ArrayProxy is a concrete class that can be instantiated to\n    implement array-like behavior. This class uses the Array Mixin by way of\n    the MutableArray mixin, which allows observable changes to be made to the\n    underlying array.\n  \n    This mixin defines methods specifically for collections that provide\n    index-ordered access to their contents. When you are designing code that\n    needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you should use these methods\n    instead of Array primitives because these will properly notify observers of\n    changes to the array.\n  \n    Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to\n    your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the\n    flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and \"virtual\" arrays such\n    as controllers and collections.\n  \n    You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array\n    contents in an observable-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever\n    the membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.\n  \n    To support `EmberArray` in your own class, you must override two\n    primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.\n  \n    @class EmberArray\n    @uses Enumerable\n    @since Ember 0.9.0\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var ArrayMixin = _metal.Mixin.create(_enumerable.default, (_Mixin$create = {}, _Mixin$create[_utils.EMBER_ARRAY] = true, _Mixin$create.objectsAt = function objectsAt(indexes) {\n    var _this = this;\n\n    return indexes.map(function (idx) {\n      return (0, _metal.objectAt)(_this, idx);\n    });\n  }, _Mixin$create['[]'] = nonEnumerableComputed({\n    get: function get() {\n      return this;\n    },\n    set: function set(key, value) {\n      this.replace(0, this.length, value);\n      return this;\n    }\n  }), _Mixin$create.firstObject = nonEnumerableComputed(function () {\n    return (0, _metal.objectAt)(this, 0);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.lastObject = nonEnumerableComputed(function () {\n    return (0, _metal.objectAt)(this, this.length - 1);\n  }).readOnly(), _Mixin$create.slice = function slice(beginIndex, endIndex) {\n    if (beginIndex === void 0) {\n      beginIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    var ret = _A2();\n\n    var length = this.length;\n\n    if (beginIndex < 0) {\n      beginIndex = length + beginIndex;\n    }\n\n    if (endIndex === undefined || endIndex > length) {\n      endIndex = length;\n    } else if (endIndex < 0) {\n      endIndex = length + endIndex;\n    }\n\n    while (beginIndex < endIndex) {\n      ret[ret.length] = (0, _metal.objectAt)(this, beginIndex++);\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n  }, _Mixin$create.indexOf = function indexOf(object, startAt) {\n    return _indexOf(this, object, startAt, false);\n  }, _Mixin$create.lastIndexOf = function lastIndexOf(object, startAt) {\n    var len = this.length;\n\n    if (startAt === undefined || startAt >= len) {\n      startAt = len - 1;\n    }\n\n    if (startAt < 0) {\n      startAt += len;\n    }\n\n    for (var idx = startAt;

This is one of the fundamental ways that\n    models, controllers and views communicate with each other in an Ember\n    application.\n  \n    Any object that has this mixin applied can be used in observer\n    operations. That includes `EmberObject` and most objects you will\n    interact with as you write your Ember application.\n  \n    Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,\n    but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it\n    is important to understand how to use it.\n  \n    ## Using `get()` and `set()`\n  \n    Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always\n    access properties using the get method, and set properties using the\n    set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n    computed properties to be handled properly.\n  \n    More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n  \n    ## Observing Property Changes\n  \n    You typically observe property changes simply by using the `observer`\n    function in classes that you write.\n  \n    For example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { observer } from '@ember/object';\n    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  \n    EmberObject.extend({\n      valueObserver: observer('value', function(sender, key, value, rev) {\n        // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n        // See the addObserver method for more information about the callback arguments\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n    is actually built into the `EmberObject` class on top of two methods\n    defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n    these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n    do so at runtime.\n  \n    To add an observer for a property, call:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n    ```\n  \n    This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever\n    the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n  \n    Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n    called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n    resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n    because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n  \n    @class Observable\n    @public\n  */\n  var _default = _metal.Mixin.create({\n    /**\n      Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n       This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,\n      however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n      handler.\n       Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n      of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n      simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n       ### Computed Properties\n       Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n      declared at the end, such as:\n       ```javascript\n      import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n       fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n        return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n      })\n      ```\n       When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n      called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n      itself.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n      `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.\n      If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned\n      instead.

This is useful for those times when you need to\n      implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n      properties.\n       ### Unknown Properties\n       If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n      object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n      gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n      are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n      undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n       ### Property Observers\n       In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n      change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a\n      `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any \"local\" observers\n      (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called\n      immediately.

The `key` is the property that\n      changes. The `value` property is currently reserved and unused. The `rev`\n      is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can\n      use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.\n       Usually you will not need the value or revision parameters at\n      the end.

This can be done by overriding\n    `objectAtContent`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { A } from '@ember/array';\n    import ArrayProxy from '@ember/array/proxy';\n  \n    let pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];\n    let ap = ArrayProxy.create({\n        content: A(pets),\n        objectAtContent: function(idx) {\n            return this.get('content').objectAt(idx).toUpperCase();\n        }\n    });\n  \n    ap.get('firstObject'); // .

It establishes a\n    class system based on Ember's Mixin system, and provides the basis for the\n    Ember Object Model. `CoreObject` should generally not be used directly,\n    instead you should use `EmberObject`.\n  \n    ## Usage\n  \n    You can define a class by extending from `CoreObject` using the `extend`\n    method:\n  \n    ```js\n    const Person = CoreObject.extend({\n      name: 'Tomster',\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    For detailed usage, see the [Object Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/object-model/)\n    section of the guides.\n  \n    ## Usage with Native Classes\n  \n    Native JavaScript `class` syntax can be used to extend from any `CoreObject`\n    based class:\n  \n    ```js\n    class Person extends CoreObject {\n      init() {\n        super.init(...arguments);\n        this.name = 'Tomster';\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Some notes about `class` usage:\n  \n    * `new` syntax is not currently supported with classes that extend from\n      `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. You must continue to use the `create` method\n      when making new instances of classes, even if they are defined using native\n      class syntax. If you want to use `new` syntax, consider creating classes\n      which do _not_ extend from `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. Ember features,\n      such as computed properties and decorators, will still work with base-less\n      classes.\n    * Instead of using `this._super()`, you must use standard `super` syntax in\n      native classes. See the [MDN docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Super_class_calls_with_super)\n      for more details.\n    * Native classes support using [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)\n      to set up newly-created instances. Ember uses these to, among other things,\n      support features that need to retrieve other entities by name, like Service\n      injection and `getOwner`. To ensure your custom instance setup logic takes\n      place after this important work is done, avoid using the `constructor` in\n      favor of `init`.\n    * Properties passed to `create` will be available on the instance by the time\n      `init` runs, so any code that requires these values should work at that\n      time.\n    * Using native classes, and switching back to the old Ember Object model is\n      fully supported.\n  \n    @class CoreObject\n    @public\n  */\n\n\n  var CoreObject = /*#__PURE__*/function () {\n    CoreObject._initFactory = function _initFactory(factory) {\n      factoryMap.set(this, factory);\n    };\n\n    function CoreObject(passedFromCreate) {\n      var _this = this;\n\n      // pluck off factory\n      var initFactory = factoryMap.get(this.constructor);\n\n      if (initFactory !== undefined) {\n        factoryMap.delete(this.constructor);\n\n        _container.FACTORY_FOR.set(this, initFactory);\n      } // prepare prototype...\n\n\n      this.constructor.proto();\n      var self = this;\n\n      if (true\n      /* DEBUG */\n      && _utils.HAS_NATIVE_PROXY && typeof self.unknownProperty === 'function') {\n        var messageFor = function messageFor(obj, property) {\n          return \"You attempted to access the `\" + String(property) + \"` property (of \" + obj + \").\\n\" + \"Since Ember 3.1, this is usually fine as you no longer need to use `.get()`\\n\" + \"to access computed properties.

However, there are some cases where it is preferable\n      to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property\n      value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember\n      is the `classNames` property of `Ember.View`.\n       Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated\n      property and a normal one:\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n       const Bar = EmberObject.extend({\n        // Configure which properties to concatenate\n        concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],\n         someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['bar']\n      });\n       const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['foo']\n      });\n       let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n      fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']\n      fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']\n      ```\n       This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the\n      above example:\n       ```javascript\n      let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n        someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],\n        concatenatedProperty: ['baz']\n      })\n      fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']\n      fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n       Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:\n       ```javascript\n      let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n        concatenatedProperty: 'baz'\n      })\n      view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n      ```\n       Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the\n      content of the properties.\n       In `Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and\n      `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.\n       This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n      although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently.

An example of this in use within Ember\n      is the `queryParams` property of routes.\n       Here is some sample code showing the difference between a merged\n      property and a normal one:\n       ```javascript\n      import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n       const Bar = EmberObject.extend({\n        // Configure which properties are to be merged\n        mergedProperties: ['mergedProperty'],\n         someNonMergedProperty: {\n          nonMerged: 'superclass value of nonMerged'\n        },\n        mergedProperty: {\n          page: { replace: false },\n          limit: { replace: true }\n        }\n      });\n       const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n        someNonMergedProperty: {\n          completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged'\n        },\n        mergedProperty: {\n          limit: { replace: false }\n        }\n      });\n       let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n       fooBar.get('someNonMergedProperty');\n      // => { completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged' }\n      //\n      // Note the entire object, including the nonMerged property of\n      // the superclass object, has been replaced\n       fooBar.get('mergedProperty');\n      // => {\n      //   page: {replace: false},\n      //   limit: {replace: false}\n      // }\n      //\n      // Note the page remains from the superclass, and the\n      // `limit` property's value of `false` has been merged from\n      // the subclass.\n      ```\n       This behavior is not available during object `create` calls.

The Rope provides a memory efficient\n    data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string\n    manipulation like splitting.\n  \n    Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as\n    runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms.

For example, `controller:post` looks up\n      `App.PostController` by default.\n    * there are some nuances (see examples below)\n  \n    ### How Resolving Works\n  \n    The container calls this object's `resolve` method with the\n    `fullName` argument.\n  \n    It first parses the fullName into an object using `parseName`.\n  \n    Then it checks for the presence of a type-specific instance\n    method of the form `resolve[Type]` and calls it if it exists.\n    For example if it was resolving 'template:post', it would call\n    the `resolveTemplate` method.\n  \n    Its last resort is to call the `resolveOther` method.\n  \n    The methods of this object are designed to be easy to override\n    in a subclass. For example, you could enhance how a template\n    is resolved like so:\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n    import GlobalsResolver from '@ember/application/globals-resolver';\n  \n    App = Application.create({\n      Resolver: GlobalsResolver.extend({\n        resolveTemplate(parsedName) {\n          let resolvedTemplate = this._super(parsedName);\n          if (resolvedTemplate) { return resolvedTemplate; }\n  \n          return Ember.TEMPLATES['not_found'];\n        }\n      })\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Some examples of how names are resolved:\n  \n    ```text\n    'template:post'           //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['post']\n    'template:posts/byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:posts.byline'   //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['posts/byline']\n    'template:blogPost'       //=> Ember.TEMPLATES['blog-post']\n    'controller:post'         //=> App.PostController\n    'controller:posts.index'  //=> App.PostsIndexController\n    'controller:blog/post'    //=> Blog.PostController\n    'controller:basic'        //=> Controller\n    'route:post'              //=> App.PostRoute\n    'route:posts.index'       //=> App.PostsIndexRoute\n    'route:blog/post'         //=> Blog.PostRoute\n    'route:basic'             //=> Route\n    'foo:post'                //=> App.PostFoo\n    'model:post'              //=> App.Post\n    ```\n  \n    @class GlobalsResolver\n    @extends EmberObject\n    @public\n    @deprecated\n  */\n  var DefaultResolver;\n\n  if (_deprecatedFeatures.GLOBALS_RESOLVER) {\n    DefaultResolver = /*#__PURE__*/function (_EmberObject) {\n      (0, _emberBabel.inheritsLoose)(DefaultResolver, _EmberObject);\n\n      var _super = (0, _emberBabel.createSuper)(DefaultResolver);\n\n      function DefaultResolver() {\n        return _EmberObject.apply(this, arguments) || this;\n      }\n\n      DefaultResolver.create = function create(props) {\n        // DO NOT REMOVE even though this doesn't do anything\n        // This is required for a FireFox 60+ JIT bug with our tests.\n        // without it, create(props) in our tests would lose props on a deopt.\n        return _EmberObject.create.call(this, props);\n      }\n      /**\n        This will be set to the Application instance when it is\n        created.\n         @property namespace\n        @public\n        @deprecated\n      */\n      ;\n\n      var _proto = DefaultResolver.prototype;\n\n      _proto.init = function init() {\n        (true && !(false) && (0, _debug.deprecate)('Using the globals resolver is deprecated.

It instantiates, initializes and coordinates the\n    objects that make up your app.\n  \n    Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. Although\n    Ember CLI creates this object implicitly, the `Application` class\n    is defined in the `app/app.js`. You can define a `ready` method on the\n    `Application` class, which will be run by Ember when the application is\n    initialized.\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    const App = Application.extend({\n      ready() {\n        // your code here\n      }\n    })\n    ```\n  \n    Because `Application` ultimately inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n    you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n    See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n  \n    While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the\n    other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n    going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand. It is also important\n    to understand that an `Application` is different from an `ApplicationInstance`.\n    Refer to the Guides to understand the difference between these.\n  \n    ### Event Delegation\n  \n    Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n    to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n    do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n    `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n    listener on the `body`.\n  \n    If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n    start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n    their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n  \n    `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n    well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n    example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n    called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n  \n    If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n    default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n    names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.extend({\n      customEvents: {\n        // add support for the paste event\n        paste: 'paste'\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\n    specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\n    property:\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.extend({\n      customEvents: {\n        // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n        mouseenter: null,\n        mouseleave: null\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n    body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n    an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n    inside the body.\n  \n    For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n    should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n  \n    ```app/app.js\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.extend({\n      rootElement: '#ember-app'\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\n    string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n    not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n    append views inside it!\n  \n    To learn more about the events Ember components use, see\n  \n    [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).\n  \n    ### Initializers\n  \n    To add behavior to the Application's boot process, you can define initializers in\n    the `app/initializers` directory, or with `ember generate initializer` using Ember CLI.\n    These files should export a named `initialize` function which will receive the created `application`\n    object as its first argument.\n  \n    ```javascript\n    export function initialize(application) {\n      // application.inject('route', 'foo', 'service:foo');\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Application initializers can be used for a variety of reasons including:\n  \n    - setting up external libraries\n    - injecting dependencies\n    - setting up event listeners in embedded apps\n    - deferring the boot process using the `deferReadiness` and `advanceReadiness` APIs.\n  \n    ### Routing\n  \n    In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is\n    also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n    between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n    detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n    the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import Application from '@ember/application';\n  \n    let App = Application.create({\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n      LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n    application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n    need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n    method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n  \n    If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n    `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n    begins.\n  \n    @class Application\n    @extends Engine\n    @uses RegistryProxyMixin\n    @public\n  */\n\n  var Application = _engine.default.extend({\n    /**\n      The root DOM element of the Application.

Normally,\n      Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on \"DOM ready\".\n      However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.\n       For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application\n      into a specific area on your marketing website:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let options = {\n          // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating\n          // the URL in the address bar\n          location: 'none',\n           // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a\n          // specific `div` on the page\n          rootElement: '#demo'\n        };\n         // Start the app at the special demo URL\n        App.visit('/demo', options);\n      });\n      ```\n       Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same\n      page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:\n       ```javascript\n      import MyApp from 'my-app';\n       $(function() {\n        let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n         let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();\n         let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });\n        let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });\n         Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {\n          // Both apps have completed the initial render\n          $('#loading').fadeOut();\n        });\n      });\n      ```\n       Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so\n      they will run in complete isolation by default.\n       #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)\n       This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using\n      Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.\n       ```javascript\n      const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);\n       function renderURL(url) {\n        let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();\n        let rootElement = dom.body;\n        let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };\n         return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {\n          try {\n            return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);\n          } finally {\n            instance.destroy();\n          }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`\n      object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,\n      in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only needs to\n      implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known\n      to work.\n       Since there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also\n      specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option\n      (as opposed to a selector string like `\"body\"`).\n       See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties\n      on `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n       #### Server-Side Resource Discovery\n       This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server\n      environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you\n      to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fulfill\n      a given request and eagerly \"push\" these resources to the client.\n       ```app/initializers/network-service.js\n      import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';\n      import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';\n       // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use\n      // the appropriate implementation on the client/server. This also allows the\n      // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use\n      // that for resource-discovery purpose.\n       export function initialize(application) {\n        if (window) { // browser\n          application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);\n        } else { // node\n          application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);\n        }\n         application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');\n      };\n       export default {\n        name: 'network-service',\n        initialize: initialize\n      };\n      ```\n       ```app/routes/post.js\n      import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n       // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.\n       export default Route.extend({\n        model(params) {\n          return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);\n        },\n         afterModel(post) {\n          if (post.isExternalContent) {\n            return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);\n          } else {\n            return post;\n          }\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n       ```javascript\n      // Finally, put all the pieces together\n       function discoverResourcesFor(url) {\n        return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {\n          let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');\n          return networkService.requests; // => { \"/api/posts/123.json\": \"...\" }\n        });\n      }\n      ```\n       @public\n      @method visit\n      @param url {String} The initial URL to navigate to\n      @param options {ApplicationInstance.BootOptions}\n      @return {Promise<ApplicationInstance, Error>}\n    */\n    visit: function visit(url, options) {\n      var _this = this;\n\n      return this.boot().then(function () {\n        var instance = _this.buildInstance();\n\n        return instance.boot(options).then(function () {\n          return instance.visit(url);\n        }).catch(function (error) {\n          (0, _runloop.run)(instance, 'destroy');\n          throw error;\n        });\n      });\n    }\n  });\n\n  Application.reopenClass({\n    /**\n      This creates a registry with the default Ember naming conventions.\n       It also configures the registry:\n       * registered views are created every time they are looked up (they are\n        not singletons)\n      * registered templates are not factories;

  ```\n  \n    It also binds the function directly to the instance, so it can be used in any\n    context and will correctly refer to the class it came from:\n  \n    ```hbs\n    <!-- template.hbs -->\n    <button\n      {{did-insert this.toggleShowing}}\n      {{on \"click\" this.toggleShowing}}\n    >\n      Show tooltip\n    </button>\n  \n    {{#if isShowing}}\n      <div class=\"tooltip\">\n        I'm a tooltip!\n      </div>\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    This can also be used in JavaScript code directly:\n  \n    ```js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import { action, set } from '@ember/object';\n  \n    export default class Tooltip extends Component {\n      constructor() {\n        super(...arguments);\n  \n        //

toggleShowing() {\n        set(this, 'isShowing', !this.isShowing);\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    This is considered best practice, since it means that methods will be bound\n    correctly no matter where they are used. By contrast, the `{{action}}` helper\n    and modifier can also be used to bind context, but it will be required for\n    every usage of the method:\n  \n    ```hbs\n    <!-- template.hbs -->\n    <button\n      {{did-insert (action this.toggleShowing)}}\n      {{on \"click\" (action this.toggleShowing)}}\n    >\n      Show tooltip\n    </button>\n  \n    {{#if isShowing}}\n      <div class=\"tooltip\">\n        I'm a tooltip!\n      </div>\n    {{/if}}\n    ```\n  \n    They also do not have equivalents in JavaScript directly, so they cannot be\n    used for other situations where binding would be useful.\n  \n    @public\n    @method action\n    @for @ember/object\n    @static\n    @param {Function|undefined} callback The function to turn into an action,\n                                         when used in classic classes\n    @return {PropertyDecorator} property decorator instance\n  */\n  var BINDINGS_MAP = new WeakMap();\n\n  function setupAction(target, key, actionFn) {\n    if (target.constructor !== undefined && typeof target.constructor.proto === 'function') {\n      target.constructor.proto();\n    }\n\n    if (!target.hasOwnProperty('actions')) {\n      var parentActions = target.actions; // we need to assign because of the way mixins copy actions down when inheriting\n\n      target.actions = parentActions ?

If the `itemA` and `itemB` are equal this function\n    should return `0`.\n  \n    Therefore, if this function is comparing some numeric values, simple `itemA -\n    itemB` or `itemA.get( 'foo' ) - itemB.get( 'foo' )` can be used instead of\n    series of `if`.\n  \n    Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    import { set } from '@ember/object';\n    import { sort } from '@ember/object/computed';\n  \n    class ToDoList {\n      constructor(todos) {\n        set(this, 'todos', todos);\n      }\n  \n      // using a custom sort function\n      @sort('todos', function(a, b){\n        if (a.priority > b.priority) {\n          return 1;\n        } else if (a.priority < b.priority) {\n          return -1;\n        }\n  \n        return 0;\n      })\n      priorityTodos;\n    }\n  \n    let todoList = new ToDoList([\n      { name: 'Unit Test', priority: 2 },\n      { name: 'Documentation', priority: 3 },\n      { name: 'Release', priority: 1 }\n    ]);\n  \n    todoList.priorityTodos;

The\n    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n    registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    Terminology\n    -----------\n  \n    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n  \n    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n  \n    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n  \n    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n    itself fulfill.\n  \n  \n    Basic Usage:\n    ------------\n  \n    ```js\n    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n      // on success\n      resolve(value);\n  \n      // on failure\n      reject(reason);\n    });\n  \n    promise.then(function(value) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Usage:\n    ---------------\n  \n    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n  \n    ```js\n    function getJSON(url) {\n      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  \n        xhr.open('GET', url);\n        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n        xhr.send();\n  \n        function handler() {\n          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n            if (this.status === 200) {\n              resolve(this.response);\n            } else {\n              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n            }\n          }\n        };\n      });\n    }\n  \n    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n      // on fulfillment\n    }, function(reason) {\n      // on rejection\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n  \n    ```js\n    Promise.all([\n      getJSON('/posts'),\n      getJSON('/comments')\n    ]).then(function(values){\n      values[0] // => postsJSON\n      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n  \n      return values;\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @class Promise\n    @public\n    @param {function} resolver\n    @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @constructor\n  */\n\n\n  var Promise = /*#__PURE__*/function () {\n    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n      this._id = counter++;\n      this._label = label;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n      config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n      if (noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n        this instanceof Promise ?

You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n    browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n    `denodeify` transforms the following:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) return handleError(err);\n      handleData(data);\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    into:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n    ```\n  \n    If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n    just returns the first one:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'));\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n      // ...\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n    second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n    as an array:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'), true);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result[0] -> res\n      // result[1] -> body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n  \n    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n      // result.res\n      // result.body\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let app = require('express')();\n    let render = denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n    ```\n  \n    The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n    environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n    function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n    denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let request = denodeify(require('request')),\n        cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n  \n    request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n      // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n    of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n  \n    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n      fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n        console.log('done')\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let fs = require('fs');\n    let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n    let writeFile = denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n  \n    readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n      return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n    }).then(function(){\n      console.log('done')\n    }).catch(function(error){\n      // Handle error\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method denodeify\n    @public\n    @static\n    @for rsvp\n    @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n    its last argument.

A component is made up of a template and, optionally, this component\n   * object.\n   *\n   * ## Defining a Component\n   *\n   * To define a component, subclass `Component` and add your own properties,\n   * methods and lifecycle hooks:\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n   *\n   * export default class extends Component {\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ## Lifecycle Hooks\n   *\n   * Lifecycle hooks allow you to respond to changes to a component, such as when\n   * it gets created, rendered, updated or destroyed. To add a lifecycle hook to a\n   * component, implement the hook as a method on your component subclass.\n   *\n   * For example, to be notified when Glimmer has rendered your component so you\n   * can attach a legacy jQuery plugin, implement the `didInsertElement()` method:\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n   *\n   * export default class extends Component {\n   *   didInsertElement() {\n   *     $(this.element).pickadate();\n   *   }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ## Data for Templates\n   *\n   * `Component`s have two different kinds of data, or state, that can be\n   * displayed in templates:\n   *\n   * 1. Arguments\n   * 2. Properties\n   *\n   * Arguments are data that is passed in to a component from its parent\n   * component. For example, if I have a `UserGreeting` component, I can pass it\n   * a name and greeting to use:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * <UserGreeting @name=\"Ricardo\" @greeting=\"Olá\" />\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Inside my `UserGreeting` template, I can access the `@name` and `@greeting`\n   * arguments that I've been given:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * {{@greeting}}, {{@name}}!\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Arguments are also available inside my component:\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * console.log(this.args.greeting); // prints \"Olá\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * Properties, on the other hand, are internal to the component and declared in\n   * the class. You can use properties to store data that you want to show in the\n   * template, or pass to another component as an argument.\n   *\n   * ```ts\n   * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n   *\n   * export default class extends Component {\n   *   user = {\n   *     name: 'Robbie'\n   *   }\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * In the above example, we've defined a component with a `user` property that\n   * contains an object with its own `name` property.\n   *\n   * We can render that property in our template:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * Hello, {{user.name}}!\n   * ```\n   *\n   * We can also take that property and pass it as an argument to the\n   * `UserGreeting` component we defined above:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * <UserGreeting @greeting=\"Hello\" @name={{user.name}} />\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ## Arguments vs. Properties\n   *\n   * Remember, arguments are data that was given to your component by its parent\n   * component, and properties are data your component has defined for itself.\n   *\n   * You can tell the difference between arguments and properties in templates\n   * because arguments always start with an `@` sign (think \"A is for arguments\"):\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * {{@firstName}}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * We know that `@firstName` came from the parent component, not the current\n   * component, because it starts with `@` and is therefore an argument.\n   *\n   * On the other hand, if we see:\n   *\n   * ```hbs\n   * {{name}}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * We know that `name` is a property on the component. If we want to know where\n   * the data is coming from, we can go look at our component class to find out.\n   *\n   * Inside the component itself, arguments always show up inside the component's\n   * `args` property. For example, if `{{@firstName}}` is `Tom` in the template,\n   * inside the component `this.args.firstName` would also be `Tom`.\n   */\n\n\n  var BaseComponent = /*#__PURE__*/function () {\n    /**\n     * Constructs a new component and assigns itself the passed properties.
